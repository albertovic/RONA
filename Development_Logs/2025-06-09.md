# Development Log - [June 09th 2024]

## Tasks Completed
- [ ] Task 1: Not much done, just tried out the H Bridge controllers and the arduino code is working.

## Web Resources
- [Resource 1](https://ecam-eurobot.github.io/Tutorials/mechanical/mecanum.html): Mecanum wheel robot kinematics.

## Notes
The next steps are:
- Figure out the maximum real speed of the wheels by using the rpm of the motors and the wheels radius. Make it so that it can be variable depending. Do not do de math and hardcode the velocity. Check the link.
- Figure out how to transform the velocity commands to pwm values to send the arduino.
- Make an Arduino code that manages the 4 motors.
