## Notes
The controller is expecting the velocity commands to be in the topic: /simple_velocity_controller/commands
However, Nav2 will try to publish them to the /cmd_vel topic. It is possible to remap de topic, but we will use
a multiplexor.

The idea is to publish the joy instructions to a topic named /cmd_vel_joy and let NAV2 publish its messages to 
the /cmd_vel topic. Once we have both messages, we will use a multiplexor and send the final result to the final topic: /simple_velocity_controller/commands.

I need to remake the connections and leave it as shown in the next image:
